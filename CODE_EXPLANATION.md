# Recipe Book Application - Code Explanation

## Project Structure

The Recipe Book application is built using React and follows a component-based architecture. Here's an overview of the project structure:

```

```

## Key Components

### App.js

This is the main component that sets up the routing for the application using React Router. It defines routes for:
- Home page (recipe list)
- Recipe detail view
- Add recipe form
- Edit recipe form

### Navbar.js

The navigation bar component displays the application title "Recipe Book" and contains an "Add Recipe" button positioned on the left side as requested. This button navigates to the add recipe form.

### RecipeList.js

This component fetches and displays all recipes in a responsive grid layout. Each recipe is shown as a card with:
- Recipe image
- Recipe name
- Brief description
- View, Edit, and Delete buttons

The component uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage state and fetch data from the JSON Server API. It also handles the delete functionality by making a DELETE request to the API.

### RecipeDetail.js

Displays detailed information about a selected recipe, including:
- Full-size image
- Complete description
- List of ingredients
- Cooking instructions
- Edit button

It fetches the specific recipe data based on the ID from the URL parameters.

### AddRecipe.js

Provides a form for adding new recipes with fields for:
- Recipe name
- Description
- Image URL
- Ingredients (entered as separate lines)
- Cooking instructions

When submitted, it converts the ingredients text into an array and sends a POST request to the JSON Server API.

### EditRecipe.js

Similar to AddRecipe, but pre-populates the form with existing recipe data. It fetches the current recipe data and allows the user to modify it. On submission, it sends a PUT request to update the recipe in the database.

## State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management with hooks:
- `useState` for component-level state
- `useEffect` for side effects like API calls

## API Integration

Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the JSON Server API. The main endpoints used are:
- GET `/recipes` - Fetch all recipes
- GET `/recipes/:id` - Fetch a specific recipe
- POST `/recipes` - Create a new recipe
- PUT `/recipes/:id` - Update an existing recipe
- DELETE `/recipes/:id` - Delete a recipe

## Styling

The application uses a combination of:
- Bootstrap for responsive layout and components
- Custom CSS for specific styling needs

The design is clean and user-friendly with:
- Responsive grid layout for recipe cards
- Hover effects on cards
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Clear action buttons

## Data Structure

Each recipe object in the database has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Recipe Name",
  "description": "Recipe description",
  "image": "URL to image",
  "ingredients": ["Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2", ...],
  "instructions": "Cooking instructions"
}
```

## Form Handling

Both the add and edit forms use controlled components where:
1. Form field values are stored in state
2. `onChange` handlers update the state when fields change
3. `onSubmit` handler processes the form data and makes API requests

The forms also include validation to ensure all required fields are filled out.
